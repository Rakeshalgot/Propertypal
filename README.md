## Demo Credentials

- Email: demo@propertypal.com
- Password: demo123

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for web:
   ```bash
   npm run build:web
   ```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (/docs)

This project is configured to export static web files into the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages.

1. Ensure the base path matches your repo name:
  - Update `expo.web.publicPath` and `expo.experiments.baseUrl` in `app.json` to `/<repo-name>/` and `/<repo-name>`.
  - It is currently set to `/Propertypal/`.
2. Build the web export:
  ```bash
  npm run build:web
  ```
3. Commit and push the `docs/` folder to `main`.
4. In GitHub repo settings, set Pages Source to the `/docs` folder on the `main` branch.

## Theme System

The app supports Light and Dark themes with the following colors:

### Light Theme
- Primary: hsl(173, 58%, 39%)
- Secondary: hsl(220, 14%, 96%)
- Accent: hsl(12, 76%, 61%)
- Background: #ffffff
- Text: #111827

### Dark Theme
- Primary: hsl(173, 58%, 45%)
- Secondary: hsl(220, 20%, 18%)
- Accent: hsl(12, 76%, 55%)
- Background: #0f172a
- Text: #f8fafc

Theme preference is persisted in AsyncStorage and can be toggled from the Profile screen.

## Authentication

Mock authentication is implemented using Zustand and AsyncStorage:
- Login with demo credentials or create a new account
- Auth state persists across app restarts
- Logout clears auth state and redirects to login

## Property Creation Wizard

The app includes a comprehensive 5-step wizard for creating properties:

### Step 1: Property Details
- Enter property name (required)
- Select property type (Hostel, PG, Apartment)
- Enter city location

### Step 2: Buildings
- Add multiple buildings to the property
- Edit or remove existing buildings
- At least one building required to proceed
- Buildings are initialized with empty floors array

### Step 3: Floors
- Building selector tabs with floor counts
- Add floors to each building with custom labels (e.g., G, 1, 2)
- Edit or remove floors per building
- Validation ensures all buildings have at least one floor
- Visual indicators for buildings missing floors

### Step 4: Rooms
- Building and floor selector tabs
- Add rooms with room number and share type
- Share type options: Single (1 bed), Double (2 beds), Triple (3 beds)
- Visual bed icon preview based on selected share type
- Remove rooms per floor
- Validation ensures all floors have at least one room
- Room count indicators per floor

### Step 5: Review & Save
- Comprehensive review of complete property hierarchy
- Collapsible cards for buildings, floors, and rooms
- Total statistics summary (buildings, floors, rooms, beds)
- Final validation ensures all requirements are met
- "Confirm & Save" button with accent color
- Success feedback upon save
- Automatic navigation to Properties list

All wizard data is persisted in AsyncStorage and survives app restarts.

## Data Model

```typescript
type ShareType = 'single' | 'double' | 'triple';

interface Room {
  id: string;
  roomNumber: string;
  shareType: ShareType;
}

interface Floor {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  rooms: Room[];
}

interface Building {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  floors: Floor[];
}

interface Property {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'Hostel' | 'PG' | 'Apartment';
  city: string;
  buildings: Building[];
  totalRooms: number;
  totalBeds: number;
  createdAt: string;
}
```
